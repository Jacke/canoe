/**
  * Button of an inline keyboard.
  * You must use exactly one of the optional fields.
  *
  * ''Notes:''
  * This offers an easy way for users to start using your bot in inline mode when they are currently in a private chat with it.
  * Especially useful when combined with switch_pm... actions - in this case the user will be automatically returned to the
  * chat they switched from, skipping the chat selection screen.
  * This will only work in Telegram versions released after 9 April, 2016. Older clients will display unsupported message.
  *
  * NOTE: This type of button must always be the first button in the first row.
  *
  * @param text                         Label text on the button
  * @param url                          HTTP url to be opened when button is pressed
  * @param callbackData                 Data to be sent in a callback query to the bot when button is pressed, 1-64 bytes
  * @param switchInlineQuery            If set, pressing the button will prompt the user to select one of their chats,
  *                                     open that chat and insert the bot's username and the specified inline query in the input field.
  *                                     Can be empty, in which case just the bot's username will be inserted.
  * @param switchInlineQueryCurrentChat If set, pressing the button will insert the bot's username and the
  *                                     specified inline query in the current chat's input field. Can be empty,
  *                                     in which case only the bot's username will be inserted.
  *                                     This offers a quick way for the user to open your bot in inline mode in the same chat -
  *                                     good for selecting something from multiple options.
  * @param callbackGame                 Description of the game that will be launched when the user presses the button.
