/**
  * Type which represents a description of sequence of elements.
  *
  * Such description can be applied to the actual sequence/stream of elements
  * to find the subsequences which match the description.
  *
  * For each partially matched subsequence (such that at least first element was matched)
  * one of 3 possible results is yielded:
  *  - Matched(o)   - when the whole episode was matched as a subsequence of input sequence.
  *                   Contains the result value of type `O`.
  *  - Missed(i)    - when the episode was started (partially matched) but was not fully matched.
  *                   Contains the first element of type `I` which didn't match the description.
  *  - Cancelled(i) - when the episode was cancelled by specific input.
  *                   Contains the input element of type `I` which caused cancellation.
  *
  * `Episode` forms a monad in `O` with `pure` and `flatMap`
  *
